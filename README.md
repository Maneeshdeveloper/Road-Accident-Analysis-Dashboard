 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

📊 Project Overview
The Road Accident Analysis Dashboard is an interactive data visualization project designed to analyze accident patterns, severity levels, vehicle involvement, and time-based trends.  
The main goal of this project is to transform raw accident data into meaningful insights that support road safety decisions and data-driven policy making.

This dashboard helps stakeholders understand:
- Accident frequency and trends
- High-risk locations and time periods
- Severity distribution
- Contributing factors to accidents

🎯 Objectives
- Analyze accident data to identify key risk patterns
- Visualize accident severity and casualty trends
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Support decision-making through data visualization
- Highlight areas needing safety improvements

📂 Dataset Information
The dataset includes attributes such as:
- Accident Date & Time
- Location / Area
- Vehicle Type
- Accident Severity
- Number of Casualties
- Road Conditions
